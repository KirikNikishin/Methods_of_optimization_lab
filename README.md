# Metods of Optimization
## Project on the discipline "Metods of Optimization"

This project was carried out as part of laboratory work in the discipline "Optimization Methods" and is designed to find the extremum of various spaces as quickly as possible using various optimization methods in C++.

1. The half division method
2. The Golden ratio method
3. The Fibonacci number method
4. Constant step gradient descent method
5. The method of steepest gradient descent
6. Newton's method of finding an extremum
7. Penalty method
8. The barrier function method
